# Game-of-Roulette
# A project I did while learning Matlab.

This was a very fun project to work on. It helped me make my MATLAB skills better.

Overview of how the game works:
User inputs name when he's greeted by the bot. Asks user if need to include green slots.
Whole game is set around 10 rounds where user bets how much they want to bet. Bank starts at $0.
User chooses what number to bet on and according to the rolled number, they get x times value they bet. 
User can lose money too if the color is different.
After the 10 rounds finish, bot calculates how much money the user won and spent.
